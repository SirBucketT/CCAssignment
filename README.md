cc assignment at forsbergs. Original tutorial by Brackeys aa game tutoriel.

What's been done? 

As the tutorial was made 8 years ago a lot of its functionality is deprecated and simply will not work on a modern version of Unity. So I've updated the game Unity 6.

Changed from old Unity Text not in use anymore to TextMeshPro. 

Added a fully fledged UI with animation system through the DOTween plugin - a animation tool for C# and Unity that lets you animate gameobjects inside a C# script. Thus avoiding the built in Unity animator tools. 

Cleaned up code base and modernized it more for my taste alongside following sepperation of concern and other clean code princepals.
